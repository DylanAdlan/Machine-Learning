Collaborative filtering - memory(user-based, item-based) + model(matrix factorization, latent factor models, deep learning)
1.
Advantage of model-based collaborative filtering over memory-based collaborative filtering
- Scalability
- Better accuracy

Advantage of memory-based collaborative filtering
- Simplicity
- Real time updates

2.
Primary limitation of the item-based collaborative filtering approach
- Lack of scalability (Primary)
- Cold start problem
- complexity

Advantage
- Scalability
- More accurate

3.
Techniques that combines multiple recommendation algorithms to improve accuracy and robustness
- Hybrid filtering

4.
Which approach in collaborative filtering uses the similarity between users to generate recommendations?
- User- based filtering

5.
Purpose of the memory-based approach in collaborative filtering
- to generate personalized recommendations for users based on their past interactions and the interactions of similar users or items.
- to calculate item/users similarities based on their historical interaction data

6.
Drawback of content-based filtering in recommender system
- Lack of diversity in recommendation (Main)
- Cold start problem
- Scalability issues
- Difficulty in extract user preferences

7.
Collaborative filtering can be divided into two main types
- Model-based filtering and memory-based filtering

8.
The primary goal of a recommender system is:
- To provide personalized recommendations

9.
In item-based collaborative filtering, similarities between items are typically calculated:
- By calculating cosine similarity between item vectors

10.
NOT a type of recommender system?
- Demographic filtering

ianalyse

1.
Which of the following is NOT a challenge in building a recommender system?
- Overfitting

2.
Which evaluation metric is commonly used to measure the accuracy of recommender systems?
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

3.
Primary challenge in evaluating the performance of a recommender system
- Lack of ground truth data

4.
Primary goal of matrix factorization techniques in recommender systems
- to reduce dimensionality of user- item matrix

5.
Which of the following factors is NOT considered when designing a recommender system?
- User demographics

6.
Primary advantage of using deep learning for recommendation systems
- Ability to capture complex patterns

7.
Algorithm is commonly used for matrix factorization in collaborative filtering
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

8.
Purpose of cross-validation in recommender system evaluation
- To assess model performance on unseen data

9.
The technique that can help alleviate the cold start problem in recommender systems is:
- Content-based filtering

10.
Primary drawback of the popularity-based recommendation approach is:
- Lack of personalization
