1.
purpose of a validation dataset in Machine Learning
- To test the model's performance on unseen data and tune hyperparameters.

2.
In supervised learning, what is the role of the model?
- The model is provided with labeled data and learns to 
make predictions or decisions based on that data.

3.
What is Machine Learning?
- A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms 
that can learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.

4.
Which of the following is an example of a hyperparameter in 
a Machine Learning algorithm?
- The learning rate in a gradient descent algorithm.

5.
What is the primary goal of unsupervised learning?
- To discover patterns or structures in data without labeled examples.

6.
classification problem in Machine Learning
- Recognizing handwritten digits (e.g., classifying a digit as 1, 2, 3, etc.).

7.
What type of learning is used when training a self-driving car to navigate 
without explicit instructions?
- Reinforcement Learning

8.
What is overfitting in Machine Learning?
- When a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

9.
What is the main difference between regression and classification in Machine Learning
- Regression predicts continuous values, while classification predicts categories or labels.

10.
key type of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

1.
What is an example of a binary classification problem in concept learning?
- Recognizing handwritten digits (e.g., classifying a digit as 1 or not 1).

2.
In supervised learning, what is the role of labeled examples in concept learning?
- Labeled examples are used to train the model to recognize and generalize concepts.

3.
What is the bias-variance trade-off in concept learning?
- The trade-off between a model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) 
and its ability to generalize to new data (low variance).

4.
What is an example of an unsupervised learning problem in concept learning?
- Clustering news articles into topics.

5.
In concept learning, what is feature engineering?
- The practice of designing and selecting relevant features from the data to 
improve the performance of a machine learning model.

6.
What is the primary goal of concept learning in unsupervised learning?
- To discover patterns or structures in data without labeled examples.

7. What is the primary goal of concept learning?
- To learn to classify or categorize objects based on their features.

8.
What is the "noisy data" problem in concept learning?
- Data that is full of random errors or irrelevant information, making it challenging to extract meaningful patterns.

9.
What is the primary challenge in reinforcement learning?
- Balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

10. 
What is concept learning in the context of Machine Learning?
- Learning to recognize and understand abstract concepts or categories from data.
