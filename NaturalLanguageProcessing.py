1.
Shallow learning in deep learning
- Machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data

2.
Which of the following functions can be used as an activation function in the output layer if we wish to predict the probabilities of n classes (p1, p2..pk) such that the sum of p over all n equals to1?
- Softmax

3.
The two key ideas of deep learning for computer vision________
- Convolutional neural networks and backpropagation

4.
Common uses of RNNs
- Detect fraudulent credit-card transaction
- Provide a caption for images
- Businesses Help securities traders to generate analytic reports

5.
Which of the following is a common approach to solving a classification problem with imbalanced classes?
- Resampling the data
- Using a different evaluation metric
- Adjusting the class weights

6.
In a simple MLP model with 8 neurons in the input layer, 5 neurons in the hidden layer, and 1 neuron in the output layer. 
What is the size of the weight matrices between the hidden output layer and the input hidden layer?
- [8 X 5] , [5 X 1]

7.
Which of the following techniques perform similar operations as a dropout in a neural network?
- Boosting
- Bagging
- Stacking
None of above (the answer)

8.
Which of the following techniques perform similar operations as a dropout in a neural network?
- Bagging

9.
Which of the following statement(s) correctly represents a real neuron?
- A neuron has multiple inputs but a single output only

10.
What is loss function in deep learning?
- To control the output of a neural network, you need to be able to measure how far this output is from what you expected

11.
In a neural network, knowing the weight and bias of each neuron is the most important step. If you can somehow get the correct value of weight and bias for each neuron, you can approximate any function. What would be the best way to approach this?
- Iteratively check that after assigning a value how far you are from the best values, and slightly change the assigned values values to make them better
